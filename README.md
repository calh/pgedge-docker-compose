# Experimental Docker Compose pgEdge

Rather than rely on all of the dynamically created stuff 
with Python scripts, I wanted to try to construct a 
pgEdge demonstration with plain Docker techniques

This is a work in progress for now.

Branches:

* `main` - installs tarball packages from the same S3 repo as nodectl
* `from_source` - builds postgres and spock from source
