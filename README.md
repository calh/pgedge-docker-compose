# Experimental Docker Compose pgEdge

Rather than rely on all of the dynamically created stuff 
with Python scripts, I wanted to try to construct a 
pgEdge demonstration with plain Docker techniques

This is a work in progress for now.

Directories:

* `from_packages` - installs tarball packages from the same S3 repo as nodectl

Branches:

* `from_source` - builds postgres and spock from source.  Keeping this locked to demo a bug.
